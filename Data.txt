I used the standard MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of the numbers 0-9. Challenge - to predict which number each handwritten image represents.
Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, so we can treat each image as just a 1D array, or tensor, of 784 numbers. MNIST provides 55,000 samples in a training data set, 10,000 samples in a test data set, and 5,000 samples in a "validation" data set.
For the first model I used TensorFlow Library.
Model Parameters 
Input Nodes 784
Hidden Nodes 512
Final Layer Nodes 10
Learning Rate 0.1
No of Epochs 2000
Batch size 200
This model gives about 93% accuracy.

Using same model parameters with Keras, I obtained about 98% accuracy on the test data set which is a significant improvement over the Tesnor Flow Model
